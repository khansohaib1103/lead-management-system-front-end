   - Prevent form submission until valid

2. API Error Handling
   - Network errors: Display user-friendly message
   - Server errors: Show appropriate error notifications
   - Validation errors: Display server-side validation messages

### Testing
1. Unit Tests
   - Component rendering tests
   - Form validation tests
   - API integration tests

2. End-to-End Testing
   - Form submission flow
   - Lead deletion flow
   - Error scenarios

### Deployment Guide

#### Local Deployment
1. Build frontend:
```bash
npm run build
```
